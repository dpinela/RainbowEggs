A randomizer add-on mod for Hollow Knight that randomly colorizes all Rancid Egg items.

Each egg can become one of 11 possible variants. The colorization is purely cosmetic; the eggs otherwise
function identically and appear in your inventory like ordinary Rancid Eggs.

It can be toggled by just clicking its button in the Connections menu.
