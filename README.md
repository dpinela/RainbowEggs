A randomizer add-on mod for Hollow Knight that randomly colorizes all Rancid Egg items.

Each egg can become one of 11 possible variants. The colorization is purely cosmetic; the eggs otherwise
function identically and appear in your inventory like ordinary Rancid Eggs.

It provides a single option in its connection menu, "Colorize Rancid Eggs", that determines whether or not eggs will be colorized.
